# What is Unit Testing?

A project is made of several components/systems and each each of the system is then integrated. 

First, each unit(components/systems) need to be ensured that they work alone and then only integrated.

Unit Testing checks for individual cases and has a record of the cases checked.

For example, function that adds two numbers could be checked for both positive numbers, one positive and one negative number as input, both negative numbers.

There are already unit testing frameworks available such as pytest, unittest etc
